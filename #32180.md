# p2p: Advance `pindexLastCommonBlock` early after connecting blocks #PR [32180](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32180)

- Upstream Issue [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32179]

## Background: What is happening in IBD?
During Initial Block Download (IBD), a Bitcoin node downloads the entire blockchain from its peers to sync up to the current tip (the latest block). 
To optimize this process, the node maintains a [sliding window](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/bb92bb36f211b88e4c1aa031a4364795cbd24767/src/net_processing.cpp#L110C1-L114C56) (typically 1024 blocks) to decide which blocks to request from which peers. 
The variable [`pindexLastCommonBlock`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/bb92bb36f211b88e4c1aa031a4364795cbd24767/src/net_processing.cpp#L412) represents the last block that both the local node and a specific peer have in common. 
This helps determine where to start requesting new blocks from that peer.

When the node is "stalled" (not making progress), it might kick a slow peer and download the needed block from another peer. 
Once this block is received, it can connect hundreds of blocks at once, advancing the node's tip significantly. 
However, there’s a bug in how the next steps are handled, leading to inefficiencies and potential unnecessary peer disconnections.

## The Bug 

1. The stalling is resolved, Tip advances
    - The node is stalled, which led to the  kick of the peer and hence downloaded the blocks and connected
    - The new 1024-block window now has many open slots to request blocks for.

2. `pindexLastCommonBlock` is not updated immediately
   - In the next call to FindNextBlocksToDownload (a function that decides which blocks to request from a peer), the pindexLastCommonBlock for each peer is still based on the old tip (before the stall was resolved).
   - The function calculates the window of blocks to request ([`nWindowEnd`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e1dfa4faebf3192dc4d60b8f27d47d497b7dd25a/src/net_processing.cpp#L1386)) using this outdated `pindexLastCommonBlock`.
   - Only after this calculation does FindNextBlocksToDownload update pindexLastCommonBlock to reflect the new tip.

3. Consequences of the Bug
   - Inefficiency (Reason 1): The node wastes one call to `FindNextBlocksToDownload`, iterating over blocks it already has (below the new tip) just to update pindexLastCommonBlock. These blocks don’t need to be downloaded, so this is unnecessary work.
   - Incorrect Stalling Detection (Reason 2): If no blocks are requested from a peer in this call (because the window is based on an outdated tip), the node might think the peer is stalling again. This triggers a stalling timeout, potentially disconnecting a perfectly good peer,
   - even though the original stalling situation was already resolved.
  

## Proposed Fix (PR [32180](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32180))

The PR aims to fix this by updating `pindexLastCommonBlock` earlier and using it to calculate a more accurate block request window. Here’s how:

1. Update pindexLastCommonBlock Early:
  At the start of `FindNextBlocksToDownload`, adjust `pindexLastCommonBlock` to reflect the new tip (assuming a linear chain with no forks). This makes sense because the node doesn’t need to request any blocks below the new tip from this peer.

2. Calculate nWindowEnd Based on New Tip:
  Use the updated `pindexLastCommonBlock` to calculate `nWindowEnd` (the end of the 1024-block window).
  This ensures the node requests blocks within the correct window (starting from the new tip), avoiding wasted iterations over already-known blocks.

3. Benefits:
  Efficiency: No wasted `FindNextBlocksToDownload` calls iterating over irrelevant blocks.
  Correctness: Peers won’t be incorrectly marked as stallers and disconnected, since block requests will align with the current state of the chain.

4. Additional Changes:
  The PR removes a special case (introduced in commit 49d569cb1fdd62a9da8dff51dccaf4680fe3d0eb) that’s no longer needed, as the updated logic handles it naturally.
  It updates a test ([`p2p_ibd_stalling.py`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32180/files#diff-503244ba97da2cc2db93fd6e7cfda5fff3db7bd0e78d637e3519fd556003341a)) to verify that peers aren’t incorrectly marked as stallers after a stalling situation is resolved.


# Testing the PR (to-do)

## Set Up a Test Environment
You’ll simulate a network with multiple nodes to reproduce the stalling scenario and test the fix.

## Run a Regtest Network:

### Start two nodes:
- Node 1: A "fast" node with a longer chain.
- Node 2: The node under test (running the PR code), syncing via IBD.

### Start Node 1 (Fast Node):

```bash
./src/bitcoind -regtest -datadir=./node1 -port=18444 -rpcport=18443 -daemon
```

### Generate a chain of blocks (e.g., 2000 blocks):

```bash
./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcport=18443 generate 2000
```

### Start Node 2 (Test Node):

```bash
./src/bitcoind -regtest -datadir=./node2 -port=18445 -rpcport=18446 -connect=127.0.0.1:18444 -debug=net -debug=block -daemon
```

***Notes***:
- *-connect ensures Node 2 only connects to Node 1*
- *-debug=net and -debug=block enable detailed logging to track peer behavior and block downloads.*
  
### Step 3: Reproduce the Bug (Baseline Test)
Before applying the fix, test the master branch to see the bug in action:

- Build and run master branch:
- Checkout master instead of pr-32180 and rebuild.

### Simulate Stalling:
- Let Node 2 start IBD. It will request blocks from Node 1.
- Manually pause Node 1 (e.g., with kill -STOP <pid>) to simulate a stall, then resume it (kill -CONT <pid>).

### Check logs (node2/debug.log) for:
- Blocks being requested unnecessarily (below the new tip).
- Peers being marked as stallers or disconnected after the stall resolves.

### Expected Bug Behavior:
- Node 2 wastes a FindNextBlocksToDownload call on old blocks.
- Node 1 might get disconnected due to incorrect stalling detection.

### Let's test the Fix

**Switch to PR Branch:**

Checkout pr-32180 and rebuild.

**Repeat the Scenario:**

- Run Node 1 and Node 2 as above.
- Simulate the stall and resolution.

**Monitor node2/debug.log for:**
- `pindexLastCommonBlock` being updated early in `FindNextBlocksToDownload`
- Block requests aligning with the new 1024-block window from the tip.
- No unnecessary peer disconnections.

### Expected Fixed Behavior:
- Efficient block requests starting from the new tip.
- Node 1 remains connected without being marked as a staller.

### Run the Updated Test
The PR updates p2p_ibd_stalling.py. Run it to verify the fix:

```bash
./test/functional/p2p_ibd_stalling.py
```
### Check Output:
The test should pass, confirming that peers aren’t marked as stallers after a resolved stall.

### Manual Validation
- Use bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcport=18446 getpeerinfo on Node 2 to check peer status during IBD.
- Ensure no unexpected disconnections occur and block sync progresses smoothly.
