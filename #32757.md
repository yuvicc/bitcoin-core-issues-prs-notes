# [#32757](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32757), net: Fix Discover() not running when using -bind=0.0.0.0:port

## Background
In previous pr https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31492 

This new code duplicates the code from DefaultOnionServiceTarget(). Which is problematic because if this logic has to be changed then it will have to be changed in more than one place.

Before this PR the outcome of DefaultOnionServiceTarget(default_bind_port_onion) was communicated to InitBinds() (here) 
via the entry in options.onion_binds. Adding that entry however was removed in this PR to facilitate the new condition above: 
options.bind_on_any && options.vBinds.empty() && options.onion_binds.empty() (onion_binds needs to be empty now).

One contributor [suggested](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31492#issuecomment-2941773645) another way to fix this issue in this pr method.
